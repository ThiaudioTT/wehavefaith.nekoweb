  <main>
    <p>
      I come from a land down under<br />
      Where women glow and men plunder!<br />
      Not the one in that old song rolling like thunder,<br />
      But from a place where the heat hits harder,<br />
      And life keeps rhythm like a backyard drummer. <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm an engineer born to build and tinker,<br />
      Spinning up servers quicker than a thinker.<br />
      My homelab glows in the night like a wonder,<br />
      I use Arch btw — pain pulls me under. <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      Stuck in vim since 2018,<br />
      Still tapping <code>:q!</code> like it's some holy banner.<br />
    </p>

    <p>
      Ten grams of creatine — at least — I hunger.<br />
      Guitar in hand when the cycles go asunder,<br />
      Faith, steel, thunder — they pull me from the blunder. <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      So here I stand with my nerdy song,<br />
      In this land down under where I code along. <br />
    </p>

    <br />
    <p>
      <strong>
        Can't you hear? Can't you hear the thunder?<br />
